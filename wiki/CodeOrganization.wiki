== Code Organization Guidelines ==
  # *Please dont merge your Branch to Trunk (_b2t_) until your code get reviewed.*
    * You are free to merge Trunk to your Branch (*_t2b_*), frequently.
  # Everybody work under his/her own _branch_.
  # Keep your branch in sync with _trunk_ frequently.
    * At least sync once after each problem set is done.
    * Before you start to work on a new problem set, sync with the _trunk_.
    * Please refer to [http://code.google.com/p/simplycode/wiki/SvnGuide this link] for trunk-branch sync.
  # _trunk_ organization:
    {{{
    trunk/
        - ps1/
        - ps2/
        ...
        - ps30/
    }}}
  # Each problem set directory has sub-directory for each problem. For example:
    {{{
    ps1/
        - lis/  
        - sortedmedian/  
        - sortedsum/  
    }}}
  # The directory for a problem _prob_ should have the following files:
    {{{ 
    prob.h       # Header file, declaring functions;
    prob.cc      # Algorithm implementation for those functions declared in header prob.h;
    prob-main.cc # The 'main' function, invoking functions implemented in prob.cc;
    }}}
    * For example, in directory _ps1/lis_ we have:
    {{{
    ps1/lis/
        - lis.h
        - lis.cc
        - lis-main.cc
    }}}
  # Makefile
    * If you follow the above instructions organizing your code, then your code can be compiled using a generic makefile located under _trunk/_. You just have to create a new makefile which contains only two lines content. For example, the makefile for _ps1/lis_ is:
    {{{
    EXE = lis
    include ../../makefile
    }}}
