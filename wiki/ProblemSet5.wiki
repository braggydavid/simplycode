  # {{{[bfs-dfs]}}} Given a binary tree, do breadth-first search and depth-first search. The depth-first search is actually pre-order traversal, please implement both recursive and iterative algorithms.
  # {{{[traversal]}}} Given a binary tree, do in-order and post-order traversal. Please implement both recursive and iterative algorithms.
  # {{{[getpos]}}} Given a BST (binary search tree) and an element _x_, find out the position of _x_ in the sequence generated by in-order traversal. For example, if the sequence is _1, 3, 5, 6_ and _x=5_, the position is 3 (the 3rd element in the sequence).
  # {{{[lcp]}}} Given a binary tree and two elements _x_ and _y_, find the least common parent of _x_ and _y_.
    * related: what if it's a binary search tree?
  # {{{[construct]}}} Construct a binary tree given its pre-order and in-order traversal sequences.
    * related: Construct a binary search tree given it's pre-order traversal sequence. 
  # {{{[x-cessor]}}} Find the successor and predecessor of a given element _x_ in a BST.
  # {{{[avl]}}} Implement an AVL tree, supporting insertion and deletion.
    * related: Using DSW algorithm to balance the tree.
